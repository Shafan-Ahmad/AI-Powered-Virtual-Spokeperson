# AI-Powered-Virtual-Spokeperson
Developed an AI-powered system to mimic a specific voice and simulate appearances via a 3D avatar. Integrated deep learning to create realistic deep fake videos using user-provided inputs, synchronizing facial expressions and audio. Added a text-to-speech (TTS) engine for generating audio-visual outputs from text.


# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Project

This project implements a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system using Python libraries like `gTTS`. It enables users to convert text input into speech audio files.

## Features
- Converts text input into natural-sounding speech.
- Supports multiple languages (based on gTTS capabilities).
- Simple and user-friendly interface for generating audio files.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `txtToSpeech_(1) (1) (1).ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to provide text input.
3. Generate and save the audio output.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- Requests library for HTTP operations

## Output
The generated audio files are saved in the project directory and can be played using any media player.
